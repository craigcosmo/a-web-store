Example usage:\n *\n *   var Props = require('ReactPropTypes');\n *   var MyArticle = React.createClass({\n *     propTypes: {\n *       // An optional string prop named \"description\".\n *       description: Props.string,\n *\n *       // A required enum prop named \"category\".\n *       category: Props.oneOf(['News','Photos']).isRequired,\n *\n *       // A prop named \"dialog\" that requires an instance of Dialog.\n *       dialog: Props.instanceOf(Dialog).isRequired\n *     },\n *     render: function() { ... }\n *   });\n *\n * A more formal specification of how these methods are used:\n *\n *   type := array|bool|func|object|number|string|oneOf([...])|instanceOf(...)\n *   decl := ReactPropTypes.{type}(.isRequired)?\n *\n * Each and every declaration produces a function with the same signature. This\n * allows the creation of custom validation functions. For example:\n *\n *  var MyLink = React.createClass({\n *    propTypes: {\n *      // An optional string or URI prop named \"href\".\n *      href: function(props, propName, componentName) {\n *        var propValue = props[propName];\n *        if (propValue != null && typeof propValue !== 'string' &&\n *            !(propValue instanceof URI)) {\n *          return new Error(\n *            'Expected a string or an URI for ' + propName + ' in ' +\n *            componentName\n *          );\n *        }\n *      }\n *    },\n *    render: function() {...}\n *  });\n *\n * @internal\n */\n\nvar ANONYMOUS = '<<anonymous>>';\n\nvar ReactPropTypes = {\n  array: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('array'),\n  bool: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('boolean'),\n  func: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('function'),\n  number: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('number'),\n  object: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('object'),\n  string: createPrimitiveTypeChecker('string'),\n\n  any: createAnyTypeChecker(),\n  arrayOf: createArrayOfTypeChecker,\n  element: createElementTypeChecker(),\n  instanceOf: createInstanceTypeChecker,\n  node: createNodeChecker(),\n  objectOf: createObjectOfTypeChecker,\n  oneOf: createEnumTypeChecker,\n  oneOfType: createUnionTypeChecker,\n  shape: createShapeTypeChecker\n};\n\n/**\n * inlined Object.is polyfill to avoid requiring consumers ship their own\n * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is\n */\n/*eslint-disable no-self-compare*/\nfunction is(x, y) {\n  // SameValue algorithm\n  if (x === y) {\n    // Steps 1-5, 7-10\n    // Steps 6.b-6.e: +0 != -0\n    return x !== 0 || 1 / x === 1 / y;\n  } else {\n    // Step 6.a: NaN == NaN\n    return x !== x && y !== y;\n  }\n}\n/*eslint-enable no-self-compare*/\n\nfunction createChainableTypeChecker(validate) {\n  function checkType(isRequired, props, propName, componentName, location, propFullName) {\n    componentName = componentName || ANONYMOUS;\n    propFullName = propFullName || propName;\n    if (props[propName] == null) {\n      var locationName = ReactPropTypeLocationNames[location];\n      if (isRequired) {\n        return new Error('Required ' + locationName + ' `' + propFullName + '` was not specified in ' + ('`' + componentName + '`.'));\n      }\n      return null;\n    } else {\n      return validate(props, propName, componentName, location, propFullName);\n    }\n  }\n\n  var chainedCheckType = checkType.bind(null, false);\n  chainedCheckType.isRequired = checkType.bind(null, true);\n\n  return chainedCheckType;\n}\n\nfunction createPrimitiveTypeChecker(expectedType) {\n  function validate(props, propName, componentName, location, propFullName) {\n    var propValue = props[propName];\n    var propType = getPropType(propValue);\n    if (propType !== expectedType) {\n      var locationName = ReactPropTypeLocationNames[location];\n      // `propValue` being instance of, say, date/regexp, pass the 'object'\n      // check, but we can offer a more precise error message here rather than\n      // 'of type `object`'.\n      var preciseType = getPreciseType(propValue);\n\n      return new Error('Invalid ' + locationName + ' `' + propFullName + '` of type ' + ('`' + preciseType + '` supplied to `' + componentName + '`, expected ') + ('`' + expectedType + '`.'));\n    }\n    return null;\n  }\n  return createChainableTypeChecker(validate);\n}\n\nfunction createAnyTypeChecker() {\n  return createChainableTypeChecker(emptyFunction.thatReturns(null));\n}\n\nfunction createArrayOfTypeChecker(typeChecker) {\n  function validate(props, propName, componentName, location, propFullName) {\n    if (typeof typeChecker !== 'function') {\n      return new Error('Property `' + propFullName + '` of component `' + componentName + '` has invalid PropType notation inside arrayOf.');\n    }\n    var propValue = props[propName];\n    if (!Array.isArray(propValue)) {\n      var locationName = ReactPropTypeLocationNames[location];\n      var propType = getPropType(propValue);\n      return new Error('Invalid ' + locationName + ' `' + propFullName + '` of type ' + ('`' + propType + '` supplied to `' + componentName + '`, expected an array.'));\n    }\n    for (var i = 0;

If `g` is as above and `_` is `R.__`, the\n     * following are equivalent:\n     *\n     *   - `g(1, 2, 3)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2, 3)(1)`\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1)(2)`\n     *   - `g(_, _, 3)(1, 2)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1)(3)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(1, 3)`\n     *   - `g(_, 2)(_, 3)(1)`\n     *\n     * @func\n     * @memberOf R\n     * @since v0.5.0\n     * @category Function\n     * @sig Number -> (* -> a) -> (* -> a)\n     * @param {Number} length The arity for the returned function.\n     * @param {Function} fn The function to curry.\n     * @return {Function} A new, curried function.\n     * @see R.curry\n     * @example\n     *\n     *      var sumArgs = (...args) => R.sum(args);\n     *\n     *      var curriedAddFourNumbers = R.curryN(4, sumArgs);\n     *      var f = curriedAddFourNumbers(1, 2);\n     *      var g = f(3);\n     *      g(4); //=> 10\n     */\n    var curryN = _curry2(function curryN(length, fn) {\n        if (length === 1) {\n            return _curry1(fn);\n        }\n        return _arity(length, _curryN(length, [], fn));\n    });\n\n    /**\n     * Decrements its argument.\n     *\n     * @func\n     * @memberOf R\n     * @since v0.9.0\n     * @category Math\n     * @sig Number -> Number\n     * @param {Number} n\n     * @return {Number}\n     * @see R.inc\n     * @example\n     *\n     *      R.dec(42); //=> 41\n     */\n    var dec = add(-1);\n\n    /**\n     * Returns the second argument if it is not `null`, `undefined` or `NaN`\n     * otherwise the first argument is returned.\n     *\n     * @func\n     * @memberOf R\n     * @since v0.10.0\n     * @category Logic\n     * @sig a -> b -> a | b\n     * @param {a} val The default value.\n     * @param {b} val The value to return if it is not null or undefined\n     * @return {*} The the second value or the default value\n     * @example\n     *\n     *      var defaultTo42 = R.defaultTo(42);\n     *\n     *      defaultTo42(null);  //=> 42\n     *      defaultTo42(undefined);  //=> 42\n     *      defaultTo42('Ramda');  //=> 'Ramda'\n     *      defaultTo42(parseInt('string')); //=> 42\n     */\n    var defaultTo = _curry2(function defaultTo(d, v) {\n        return v == null || v !== v ? d : v;\n    });\n\n    /**\n     * Finds the set (i.e. no duplicates) of all elements in the first list not\n     * contained in the second list.
